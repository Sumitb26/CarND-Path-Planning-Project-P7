**Path Planning Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* To design a path planner that is able to create smooth, safe paths for the car to follow along a 3 lane highway with traffic.
* The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident.
* The car drives according to the speed limit.
* Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
* Car does not have collisions.
* The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
* The car is able to change lanes.

### Compilation
Code complies correctly.


### Valid trajectories

#### The car is able to drive at least 4.32 miles without incident.

#### The car drives according to the speed limit.
No speed limit red message was seen.

#### Max Acceleration and Jerk are not Exceeded.
Max jerk red message was not seen.

#### Car does not have collisions.
No collisions.

#### The car stays in its lane, except for the time between changing lanes.
The car stays in its lane most of the time but when it changes lane because of traffic or to return to the center lane.

#### The car is able to change lanes.
The car change lanes when the there is a slow car in front of it, and it is safe to change lanes (no other cars around) or when it is safe to return the center lane.
